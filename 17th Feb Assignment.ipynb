    "Ans. Some of the Features of MongoDB are: \n",
    "    Document Model:- MongoDB has been designed with developer productivity and flexibility in mind. It is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored as documents, and documents are grouped in collections. The document model is a lot more natural for developers to work with because documents are self-contained and can be treated as objects. This means that developers can focus on the data they need to store and process, rather than worrying about how to split the data across different rigid tables.\n",
    "    Sharding:- Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances, or “shards.” When applied to particularly large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute and better execute what might otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries. Without sharding, scaling a growing web application with millions of daily users is nearly impossible.\n",
    "    Replication:- When your data only resides in a single server, it is exposed to multiple potential points of failure, such as a server crash, service interruptions, or even good old hardware failure. Any of these events would make accessing your data nearly impossible.Replication allows you to sidestep these vulnerabilities by deploying multiple servers for disaster recovery and backup. Horizontal scaling across multiple servers greatly increases data availability, reliability, and fault tolerance. Potentially, replication can help spread the read load to the secondary members of the replica set with the use of read preference.\n",
    "    Authentication:- Authentication is a critical security feature in MongoDB. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the database. Without authentication, anyone can access your data.MongoDB provides a number of authentication mechanisms for users to access the database. The most common is the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which is the default. When used, SCRAM requires the user to provide an authentication database, username, and password.\n",
    "    Indexing:- In our experience, the number one issue that many technical support teams fail to address with their users is indexing. Done right, indexes are intended to improve search speed and performance. A failure to properly define appropriate indexes can and usually will lead to a myriad of accessibility issues, such as problems with query execution and load balancing.Without the right indexes, a database is forced to scan documents one by one to identify the ones that match the query statement. But if an appropriate index exists for each query, user requests can be optimally executed by the server."
